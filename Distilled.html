    <p style="color:orange">Distilled water is water that has been boiled into vapor and condensed back into liquid in a separate container.<br>
        Impurities in the original water that do not boil below or near the boiling point of water remain in the original container.<br>
        Thus, distilled water is a type of purified water.</p>
